# Machine-learningMachine learning is an AI technique that teaches computers to learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to "learn" information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.

Machine learning can be supervised, unsupervised, or reinforced.

In this repo, you will see examples and implementations of various algorithms of machine learning, which include supervised and unsupervised learning.
